# Haas Leading People Midterm

## Week 1: Introduction

### Management vs. Leadership
> Good management and leadership will better align employee incentive and organizational goals.
* Manager != Leader, becoming a good leader might require being a good manager.


### Important Leadership Features
* Employment Engagement: achieving organizational, retaining talent, and building a positive workplace culture.
* Innovation: Creativity, experimentation, and continuois learning within the organization.
* Transparency: Making decisions transparently and inclusively 
* Strong organizational culture: Strong, supportive and collaborative culture.

### Data and Evidence

* Causal Inference: Establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between variables.
  * e.g. Medical trials
* Prediction: Predict the outcome accurately without establishing underlying causal  relationship.
  * e.g. Demand forecasting

### Experimental Design

* Research participants: **Randomly(hallmark)** assign participants to treatment and control groups.
  * If for practical reasons, random assignment is not possible, use **quasi-experimental** design.
* Independent variable: The variable that is manipulated in experiment.
* Dependent variable: The variable that is measured in experiment.
![alt text](./image/image.png)
  * Unfortunately,  we can never observe the same unit under both treatment and control conditions at the same time.
To make the causal inference possible, we compute an average treatment effect (ATE) by studying a sample of subjects each of which was **randomly** assigned to either treatment or control group.

**The risk of confounding variables**: Variables that are correlated with both the treatment and the outcome.

### Challenges in Experimental Design

* Small sample size: Reduces the statistical power of the experiment.
  * Solution: Conduct a power analysis to determine the sample size needed to detect the effect of interest.
* Non-Compliance: Dilutes the treatment effect.
  * Solution: Monitoring, compliance incentives, and intention-to-treat analysis.
* Contamination: When the control group is exposed to the treatment. This can obscure the difference.
  * Solution: Physical separation and ensure clear communication about the treatment.
* **Hawthorne Effect**: When participants change their behavior because they know they are being observed.
  * Solution: Use a placebo group or a double-blind experiment.
* Attrition: High dropout rate can bias the results, especially if the attrition rates differ between treatment and control groups.
  * Solution: Use intention-to-treat or follow up protocals. 
* Short-Duration: The treatment effect may not be observable in the short term.
  * Solution: Be explicit about the time horizon of the study and consider long-term effects.

## Week 2: Know Yourself and Others

Goal
> Know yourslf and your cognitive biases.
> Understand other people's personalities and cognitive biases.

**Dispositionism**: The tendency to attribute behavior to internal factors such as personality traits rather than external factors.

**Neuroticism**: The tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and anger.
  * The big five model captures neuroticism

### The big Five Personality Traits

1. Extroversions: Outgoing, social, and assertive.
   * HIgh extroversion is associated with leadership emergence --> Manager/Sales People.
2. Agreeableness: Good-natured, cooperative, and warm.
   * High agreeableness is associated with positive relationships, gratitude, and forgiveness --> Volunteer in community.
3. Conscientiousness: Responsible, dependable, and organized.
    * High conscientiousness is associated with job performance and extrinsic motivation --> Accountant.
4. Openness to Experience: Creative, curious, and imaginative.
    * High openness has been found to contribute to one's likelihood pf obtaining leadership positions. 
5. Emotional Stability: Calm, secure, and self-confident.

> Big 5 personality traits are fundamental core personality features to understand individual differences in behavior. 
  * Other tests give you a type while big five put you in a scale of 1-5 for each trait.

> However, they should NOT BE a driver of hiring or promotion decisions.

### Authenticity 
> Dispositionisn and situationism meet at authenticity.

**Situationism**: The belief that behavior is determined by situational factors like immediate environment and social context (e.g Work Environment).
![alt text](./image/authenticity.png)

**Authenticity**: Alignment between one's inner feelings and your expressed behavior.
  * Can be a self-focused judgement or other-focused judgement, but they are not always aligned.

The Authenticity Paradox: Leaders need to adapt to new roles without losing their sense of self, but flexibility is essential for growth

* Self-perceived authenticity: The extent to which you feel authentic.
  * rubust predictor of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and well-being.
  * higher engagement and job satisfaction.
* Other-perceived authenticity: The extent to which others perceive you as authentic.
  * stakeholder perceptions of leadership effectiveness, employee engagement, and org culture.


### Takeaways
1. Personality tests can be useful for self-awareness, but have accuracy and inclusivity limitations.
2. The Big Five and Dark Side traits provide a framework for understanding workspace behavior.
3. We contain a multitude of selves, which can generate authenticity challenges.
4. You can be true to yourself and adapt to your environment.

## Week 3: Decision Making
![alt text](./image/maut.png)

### Rational Approach 
* **Boundary rational**: People are not infinitely rational, but they are rational within the boundaries of their cognitive limitations.
* Satisfice: People make decisions that are good enough, rather than optimal.

### MAUT: Multi-Attribute Utility Theory
1. Identify the decision criteria.
2. Assign weights to the criteria.
3. Score each option on each criterion.
4. Multiply the scores by the weights and sum them up and rate
5. Choose the option with the highest score.

> **Decision making bias**: 1. confirmation bias, 2.availability 3. representativeness.

### Confirmation Bias
Tendency to seek out information that confirms our beliefs and ignore information that contradicts them.
1. **Confirmation trap**: Seeking out information that confirms our beliefs.
  * e.g. M&A: Buyers gather data to support their decision to buy and overlook data that suggests otherwise.
  * e.g. Personnel decisions: Managers focus on the positive aspects of a candidate and ignore the negative aspects.
  * e.g. Product management: A company may launch a product based only on positive internal feedback, ignoring external warnings of potential failure

-------- What do we do ----------------
* Personal: Ask yourself what you might be wrong. Actively **seek out disconfirmatory** evidence.

* Organizational: 
  * Reward decision making process not just outcomes.
  * instututionalize dissent.

2. Sampling on dependent variable: Only looking at the data that supports our hypothesis.  
  * e.g. Successful founders brush their teeth, so brushing teeth is a key to success.
-------- What do we do ----------------
* Is it plausible that subjects not included in the sample exhibit the same behavior?
* Are all 4 cells of the 2x2 table filled?
![alt text](./image/sampling.png)

3. **Egocentrism/Overconfidence**: Overestimating our own abilities and knowledge, which is greater than the objective accuracy of those abilities.

##### Better-than-average effect

BTAE is larger:
* personality traits
* positive dimensions
* simple, familiar tasks and tasks relevant to self-identity
-------- What do we do ----------------
* Personal: 
  * Practice perspective-taking.
  * Work on self-awareness by incorporating external tools and "helpful" comparisons.

### Availability
Tendency for people to based judgements on **recent or readily available** information and pay little attention to relevant historical data. 
* Retrievability: memory structure affect the search process 
  * e.g. Recent performance holds undue weight in performance evaluations.
* Ease of recall: Making decision based on vividness of information.
  * e.g. Annual fatalities from shark attacks are 10x less than fatalities from falling coconuts, but people are more afraid of sharks.
* Anchoring: Paying attention to irrevant "anchors" when making decisions.
  * e.g. Real estate agents use the listing price as an anchor.
  * e.g. Do you think average German car costs more or less than $100,000? (100,000 is an anchor - can be random)

### Representativeness
Tendency to assume a member of a group has the same characteristics as the group itself.
* e.g. Assuming a person who is a vegetarian is also an environmentalist.
![alt text](./image/fallacy.png)

Examples:
* REPRESENTATIVENESS: INSENSITIVITY TO BASE RATES
* REPRESENTATIVENESS: INSENSITIVITY TO SAMPLE SIZE

**Conjunction fallacy**: Assuming that the conjunction of two events is more likely than one of the events alone.
  * e.g. Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement. Is it more likely that Linda is a bank teller or a bank teller and a feminist?

-------- What do we do ----------------
* Collect good data and avoid assuming casual relationships.
* Bring people together use collective intelligence.

### Framing 
The way information is presented can influence decision making.

> Losts are more painful than gains are pleasurable.
* People are risk-averse when the outcome is framed in terms of gains.
* People are risk-seeking when the outcome is framed in terms of losses.
![alt text](./image/Risk.png)

-------- What do we do ----------------
* Personal: 
  * Consider the framing of the decision.
  * Use a structured decision-making process.

* Organizational:
  * Use a structured decision-making process.
  * Motivate towards change and risk: use loss frame ()
  * Motivate towards stability and security: use gain frame 

## Week 4: Movitation at Work

### Expectancy Theory
People are motivated to act in a certain way because they expect a particular outcome.
> Motivation = Expectancy x Instrumentality x Valence
* Expectancy: Effort -> Performance
* Instrumentality: Performance -> Outcome
* Valence: Outcome -> Satisfaction
![alt text](./image/expectancy.png)

### Feedback not easy

Challenge
* illusion of transparency: overestimating how well others understand our thoughts and feelings.
* Sugarcoating: Softening the feedback to avoid hurting the recipient's feelings.
  * Feedback sandwich: Positive feedback -> Negative feedback -> Positive feedback
* Not specific enough: Vague feedback is not actionable.

Positive vs Negative Feedback
* Positive feedback: Reinforces good behavior and increases motivation. Works best for those not fully committed to the task.
* Negative feedback: Corrects mistakes and improves performance. Works best for those who are already committed to the task.

> Feedback should be provided frequently, specific, and actionable.
* Feedback should be given in a timely manner.
* Feedbacj should be specific and candid vs vague and general.
* Feedback should be future-oriented and focused on improvement.
* Frame negative feedback as a pathway to improvement.
* Give feedback in a private setting, and do in the morning!

### Rewards

1. Intrinsic vs Extrinsic motivation
* Intrinsic motivation: Motivation that comes from within.
  * e.g. Enjoying the task, feeling of accomplishment.
* Extrinsic motivation: Rewards that have no effect on how enjoyable the task is.
  * e.g. Money, praise, promotion.

> Extrinsic rewards may erode intrinsic motivation.
> If someone is already intrinsically motivated, extrinsic rewards may reduce their motivation.

2. Immediate vs Delayed rewards

Immediate rewards are more effective than delayed rewards.

### Job Crafting 

1. Task crafting: Changing the number, type, or nature of tasks.
2. Relational crafting: Changing the number, type, or nature of relationships; style of interaction.
3. Cognitive crafting: Changing the way you perceive the job.

### Motivation and fairness

**halo effect**: The tendency to assume that someone who is good at one thing is good at everything.

**input bias**: only successful companies are studied, while failures are ignored

Good reward system can be spoiled by perceived unfairness, a lack of attetion and lack of promised delivery.


## Week 5: Teamwork 

### How team operate
1. Divide and conquer
2. Aggregate information
  * Key Concept: The wisdom of crowds often leads to accurate decisions, but only when diversity, independence, and decentralization are present.
    * Example: Decentralized social networks where all opinions are weighted equally result in more accurate decisions.
  * **social loafing:** the tendency of individuals to exert less effort when working in a group than when working alone.
3. Expertise 
  * **groupthink**: the tendency of group members to conform, resulting in a narrow view of the problem. Teams that allow diverse input and decentralization `avoid "groupthink"` and leverage the true wisdom of the crowd.

### Challenges of Teams: 
Teams can face challenges like **excessive cohesion**, which can lead to conformity and groupthink, suppressing dissent and reducing decision quality.

**Encouraging Cohesiveness**: Team cohesiveness can be encouraged by making the group smaller, aligning on group goals, spending more time together, increasing the status of group membership, stimulating competition with other groups, and rewarding the group as a whole.

### How Google Sold Its Engineers on Management

Key Takeaways:
* Google’s engineers were initially skeptical about the value of managers. Project Oxygen used data to demonstrate that good management matters.
* The project identified eight key behaviors of effective managers and helped integrate these behaviors into Google’s culture.

Key Concepts:

* Data-Driven Management: Google used data analysis to prove that management improves employee satisfaction, productivity, and retention.
* Key Managerial Behaviors: Effective managers are good coaches, empower their teams, communicate well, and support career development.

Example:
Google discovered that employees with high-scoring managers reported higher satisfaction with innovation and career development. For instance, employees appreciated managers who provided stretch assignments to foster growth.

## Week 6: Negotiation

Negotiation is rarely a competition, but rather a collaboration to create value.
> Many negotiations are **not zero-sum games**

Major pitfalls in negotiation:
1. **Winner's Curse**: Overpaying for an asset because you are too focused on winning the negotiation.
2. **Agreement Bias**: Settling for worse terms than you could have gotten because you are too eager to reach an agreement.
3. **Hubris**: Walking away from a deal despite the opportunity to improve your position.
4. **Dynsfunctional rivalry**: Comparing your outcomes to others, rather than focusing on your own goals.

> BATNA: Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement

> Target point: The ideal outcome you would like to achieve.(ambitious yet plausible)

Reservation price: You become indifferent between accepting the deal and walking away.
* Should not change BATNA, but can be based on BATNA.

ZOPA: Zone of Possible Agreement
* Overlapping range of reservation prices for both parties.
* in some cases, ZOPA may not exist.
![alt text](./image/zopa.png)

### Steps in Negotiation

1. Establish interests 
* positions: what you want
* interests: why you want it
* Multiple-issue agenda: Identify multiple issues to negotiate on.
  * Breakdown single issue into multiple issues.
  * Think of other interests and related issues.

2. Develop a scoring system

Try to quantify all issues in terms of common metrics (utility; dollar...). Then assign weights to each issue.
  * e.g. Salary, vacation days, work hours, etc.

Open the door for agent: allow someone else to go in and negotiate effectively on your behalf.

3. Establish Bargining Points
* BATNA
* Reservation point: Know when to walk away.
* Target point: Ideal outcome.

4. Consider the other side 
* Understand the other party's interests and see the world through their eyes.
   * Interests and positions
   * Their BATNA 
   * Reveel their power --> Give you insight into their reservation point.
   * Help you adjust your target point.

5. Plan and practice 
* Plan tactics
  * e.g. Make the first offer, anchor high, etc.
  * e.g. If they do X then I will do Y.
* Planned questions and responses
  * e.g. What is your budget?

6. Make an offer
* Advantages of making the first offer
  * Anchor the negotiation
  * Tend to lead to better outcomes
* disadvantages of making the first offer
  * If there is asymmetric information, you may reveal too much.
> If you can make guess on their reservation point, you SHOULD make the first offer.

## Week 7: Power and Persuasion in Organizations

How do leaders shape behavior in organizations?

1. By exercising power
* Positional power: Power that comes from your position in the organization.
* Reward power: Provide reward in exchange for compliance.
* Coercive power: Punish for non-compliance by threatening punishment.
* Expert power: Power that comes from your expertise.
  * e.g. Doctors, lawyers, professors.
* Referent power: Power that comes from being liked and respected.
  * e.g. sam altman, elon musk.

> Reward and coercive power may lead to compliance, but not engagement.

> Expert and referent power creates more lasting influence because they are based on credibility and respect.

2. By using persuasion
* Persuasion leads to more voluntary cooperation and long-term commitment.

> Leaders combine power with effective persuasion -> increase influence without resorting to coercion.

### Persuading the un-persuadable

1. Overconfident People
* Let them recogize the gap by letting them teach/explain to you. 

2. Stubborn People
* Feeding them ideas (anchor) and let them build on them.

3. Narcissists
* Praise them in an area different from the one you want to influence.

4. Disagreeable People
* They dont want you to bend -> argue with them


## Week 8: Social Networks

Social networks are **invisible** and incredibly complex. Huge impact on professional success.

What does network do
* Access to opportunities, ideas and information.
* Allow/prevent you from mobilizing others.
* Influence your behavior and attitudes.

Revere and Dawes Network 
![alt text](./image/network.png)
* Revere: High diversity, low redundancy, brokerage 
* Dawes: Low diversity, high redundancy, closure with no brokerage

Structural holes: Gaps between groups that can be bridged by a broker.

### Strength of weak ties
* Weak ties: Ties that are not strong, but provide access to new information. Weak ties are associated with:
  * New job opportunities
  * Promotion and salary increase
  * Creatvity and innovation

> Weak ties are more important than strong ties for accessing new information and opportunities.
![alt text](./image/weak_tie.png)

### Barrier to build diverse network
* Homophily: Tendency to associate with similar others -> suppress opportunities to access new information.
> People tend to connect with similar people not just because of homophily but also due to **social influence**. Social network may provide resources and also shape the beliefs and behaviors of its members.
  * e.g. democratic social network -> more likely to be democratic.

### Other stats 
* Betweenness centrality: The extents which you act as a 'bridge' between two people in a network. 
  * High betweenness centrality: You are a broker.

* Eigenvector: Weight the people you are connected to by their own connections.
  * High eigenvector centrality: You are connected to other well-connected people.

* Constraint: The extent to which your connections are connected to each other.
  * Lower constraint -> less overlap between your connections -> more diverse information.


> Social influence in network may increase the inequality and unpredictability of outcomes.

## Week 9: Organizational Culture

> A strong culture is intensiely held and widely shared, and **consistently displayed**.

Create a strong culture
1. **Selection**: Hire people who fit the culture.
2. **Socialization**: Teach the culture to new employees.
  * e.g. Onboarding at Google
3. **Selecctive Attrition**: Remove people who do not fit the culture.

How does culture affect behavior?
1. **Effective machanism of control**: Culture can be a powerful control mechanism.
2. **Intrinsic motivation**: Culture can motivate employees to act in a certain way.
3. **Shared Goal**: Increase commitment and to org-level goals.
4. **Strategic position and differentiation**: Culture can fit org interests and employees' interests.

Iceberg model of culture
* **Artifacts**: Visible symbols of culture.
  * e.g. Dress code, office layout, etc.
* **Espoused Values**: Explicitly stated values and norms.
* **Assumption**: Unconscious beliefs and values.
  * e.g. Google's assumption: "We are a family"

### Toxic Culture
Toxic People: actions and behaviors that are harmful to others.
Toxic Environment: Environment that is harmful to employees' well-being.

> Some researches found that toxic workers are more productive than average workers, but the cost of their behavior outweighs the benefits.

### key takeaways
1. Successful leaders should actively shape and codify their organization's culture, enacting all levels. 
2. Allign culture with organizational goals and values.
3. Toxic people have long-lasting negative effects on the organization.
